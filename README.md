# Setup Meteor M-N2-3 with LRPT-Decoder and MeteorGIS

<img src="img/meteor_m_2.gif" alt="" width="256" height="204" border="0"></a><br>

Meteor-M series are equipped with two imaging payloads.<br>

MSU-MR is a low-resolution instrument operating at visible-light and near-infrared wavelengths.<br>
It will take wide-angle images of the Earth to help monitor cloud cover and the icecaps.<br>

The second image device, KMSS-2, provides complimentary high-resolution visible-light images of more specific areas.<br>
            
The satellite also carries two sounding instruments, MTVZA-GYa microwave radiometer and IKFS-2 infrared spectrometer, which will build profiles of temperatures,
humidity and wind conditions within the atmosphere.<br>
            
As well as direct weather monitoring, Meteor-M series are used to relay data from automated weather stations across the Earths surface.<br>
BRK, also known as SSPD, is the communications payload that will facilitate this, receiving data from stations and re-transmitting it for collection and analysis.<br>

A Kospas-SARSAT emergency communications payload, RK-SM-MKA, is also carried to detect and relay distress signals, aiding search-and-rescue operations around the world.<br>

As for searching continuous ways to improve Meteor reception, Vasili (rtl-sdr.ru - Plugins) and Oleg (LrptDecoder) did have the great idea to develop a Meteor Demodulator Plugin in order to receive Meteor M-N2 (and successors) images in real time thru LrptDecoder and trying to automate configuration changes with having minimal user input.<br>

Although this guide with the SDRSharp is outdated in 2023, and there are also other ways for software moderate reception, many people are still using it, therefore this update.<br>

## Hardware<br>

To Use Real time image processing with Meteor, the following is needed for setup:<br>

SDR Radio capable receiver:<br>

<a href="https://airspy.com/airspy-r2/" target="_blank"><img src="img/airspy.png" alt="" width="256" height="204" border="0"></a><br>

<a href="https://airspy.com/airspy-r2/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Airspy R2</a><br>

Airspy R2 sets a new level of performance in the reception ofthe VHF and UHF bands thanks to its low-IF architecture based on Rafael Micro R820T2 and a high quality Oversampling 12bit ADC and state of the art DSP.<br>

In Oversampling Mode, the Airspy R2 applies Analog RF and IF filtering to the signal path and increases the resolution to up to 16-bit using the software decimation.<br>

The Airspy R2, is 100% compatible with all the existing software including the de facto scanning standard SDR#, but also a number of popular software defined radio applications such as:<br>

SDR-Radio, HDSDR, GQRX and GNU Radio.<br>

Continuous 24 – 1700 MHz native RX range.<br>
3.5 dB NF between 42 and 1002 MHz, Maximum RF input of +10 dBm Tracking RF filters.<br>
2bit ADC @ 20 MSPS (10.4 ENOB, 70dB SNR, 95dB SFDR), 10MSPS IQ output.<br>
4.5v software switched Bias-Tee to power LNA’s and up/down-converters.<br>

<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr/nesdr-smartee-sdr.html" target="_blank">Nooelec NESDR SMArTee - Premium RTL-SDR</a><br>

Premium RTL-SDR w/ aluminum enclosure, always-on bias tee, 0.5PPM TCXO and SMA input.<br>

The new PCB design of the NESDR SMArTee results in lower temperatures.<br>
A custom heatsink is affixed to the primary PCB with 3M thermal adhesive, to wick heat away from the circuit board and towards the enclosure.<br>

Power consumption has been reduced by an average of 10mA, which means less heat is generated compared to other designs.<br>
The result is much lower board-level temperatures--increasing stability, improving sensitivity and ensuring maximum frequency range capability.<br>

Bias-Tee features:<br>
RF-suitable 4.2V regulator provides DC output to power your active electronics.<br>
Bias-tee does NOT need to be enabled with hardware or software hacks. <br>
No need to mess around with software or drivers to enable your bias tee!<br>

RTL2832U Demodulator/USB interface IC, R820T2 tuner IC<br>
4.2V 200mA always-on bias tee<br>

<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-addons/sawbird/sawbird-plus-noaa-308.html" target="_blank">Nooelec SAWbird+ NOAA - Premium SAW Filter &amp; Cascaded Ultra-Low Noise LNA Module 137MHz Center Frequency.</a><br>

SAWbird+ NOAA is a self-contained dual LNA module with an integrated high-performance SAW filter, designed for Meteor and NOAA weather satellites.<br>
And filter out unwanted interfering signals like pagers from airport's or other electronic pollution.<br>

It has a very high attenuation outside of the 5MHz bandpass region, centered around 137.5MHz, and a minimum of 30dB of gain within the bandpass region. <br>
Nominal current draw is 180mA.<br>

The SAWbird+ series contains 2 ultra-low-noise LNAs sandwiched around a custom-designed, high-performance SAW filter centered at the frequency of interest. <br>
Each LNA module has 2 EMI shields to separate each delicate LNA from external interference. <br>
There are also M3 mounting holes available to mount the PCB in your custom enclosure or project with standard hardware.<br>

Each module allows for 3 different power options, but you should only power with one option at any given time!<br>
The recommended power input through the SMA output port (for bias-tee capable SDRs like the above NESDR SMArTee) is 3V-5V DC. <br>
Alternatively, if you don't have a bias-tee capable SDR, you can use the external power options through the microUSB port or the power input header.<br>

<img src="img/decoder_m2-2.png" alt="" width="686" height="376"><br>

This version of LRPTDecoder will work with Meteor M-N2-3.</p>
By design, Meteor Demodulator will manage the settings of the decoder and this should reduce the number of settings, that must be done when Meteor changes operating modes.<br>

Example M2_LRPT_Decoder.ini configuration files for other modes are attached in the archive!<br>

A Satellite Tracking program like Orbitron (<a href="http://www.stoff.pl" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">http://www.stoff.pl</a>).<br>

## Setup Orbitron/SDRSharp<br>

Orbitron takes care of the doppler shift frequency correction for the carrier of the Meteor Demodulator Plugin.<br>
DDE Tracking client Plugin collects data from Orbitron or any other Tracking client.<br>

Note it's not gonna be used for correcting the main tuned frequency in SDRSharp the signal will be unlocked from the QPSK Plugin using that!<br>

If Satellite elevation &gt; 0 (AOS) trigger the start of applications needed for the receiving session:<br>
start decoder program, set modulation and bandwidth, start some plugins (Meteor Demodulator, LRPT-Decoder, MeteorGIS, IF or Baseband recorder).<br>

And send frequency correction (optional some stations report better reception without when having low or bad signal).<br>

Meteor Demodulator first synchronizes with the signal in frequency configuration of the modulation speed and modulation type (satellite name).<br>
If the satellite is gone (LOS) - stop recorders, Radio, Tracking and other plugins.<br>

Setup: <br>
Open Folder install location Orbitron\Config\setup.cfg in the driver section (end of file) below add this line required to point out your working SDRSharp install/location:<br>

[Drivers]<br>

SDRSharp=&lt;your path to SDRSharp folder&gt;\SDRSharp\SDRSharp.exe<br>

Save and start Orbitron, make sure you have a up to date TLE file containing Meteor M-N2-3 Satellite.<br>
Insert this url in Main/Click Tools Icon/TLE Updater (https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/weather.txt).<br>

Select Meteor M-N2-3 in the right list with the checkbox.<br>

<img src="img/Orbitron_1.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="525"><br>

Goto Main/Setup (the tool icon) Miscellaneous tab and set AOS notification to 0 (or any other elevation value when Meteor is receivable in your location).<br>

<img src="img/Orbitron_2.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="532"><br>

Then goto Extra tab last option AOS Notification: Make satellite active.<br>
<b>Check the correct time zone!</b><br>

<img src="img/Orbitron_3.jpg" alt="" width="673" height="525"><br>

Fill in your location/GPS coordinates in the location tab.<br>

<img src="img/Orbitron_4.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="533"><br>

Goto tab Rotor/Radio, make sure in Dnlink/MHz: 137.100Mhz is filled in (Check current Meteor Mode's overhere: <a href="https://github.com/happysat/Meteor-M-N-2-3-Satellite-Operational-Status/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/happysat/Meteor-M-N2-and-N2-2-Satellite-Operational-Status</a>),<br>
Dnlink mode: FM-W, select SDRSharp from the Driver dropdown box and click the icon next to it above the lock symbol.<br>

SDRSharp will start.<br>
Main Frequency in SDRSharp must be set to Modulation WFM and preferred bandwidth 90000 Hz.<br>
Tuner bandwidth to 1.4MSPS, 1.4 MSPS is needed IF samplerate will be &gt; 288 kHz<br>
Meteor Demodulator plugin will show a warning when using <b>lower bitrates! </b><br>

## Setup DDE-Tracking Client<br>

In options button you can choose which Tracking program is going to be used, default is Orbitron.<br>

Check the box in the DDE Tracking client Plugin 'Satellite Tracking' and after a few seconds the sat name, frequency, elevation is listed from Orbitron with Meteor's details indicating doppler is active.<br>

A minimal elevation can be set like in Orbitron for example above 5 Degrees so the tracking client will be active and not on very low passes.<br>

The config button display's the available commands in the scheduler.<br>

OQPSK_demodulator_Start - QPSK Plugin is triggered to start from DDE Tracking Client by this command Needed for M-N2-3.<br>
send_tracking_frequency_On - Starting Doppler frequency correction for Meteor Demodulator Plugin carrier if the Satellite is active (If this is unwanted remove the command).<br>
start_program_Path - LRPT-Decoder folder which includes run.bat, pointing to LRPT_Decoder.exe, explained more below.<br>

<b>LOS window section command explanation:</b><br>

send_Tracking_Frequency_Off - Doppler correction for Meteor Demodulator Plugin Carrier stops.<br>
OQPSK_demodulator_Stop - Stop Meteor Demodulator Plugin, needed for M-N2-3.<br>
radio_stop - SDRSharp stops playing.<br>
start_programm_Path - Optional custom batch file with some commands to put s-files in another folder when both Meteor's are received to separate them.<br>

Disable recorder and socket not needed.<br>
radio_tracking_frequency_On not needed for meteors. <br>
Use only with NOAA and voice satellite! <br>
For meteors need use send_tracking_frequency_On only!<br>
tracking_frequency_Hz is a internal command, part of
send_tracking_frequency. <br>
Not needed add to scheduler manually!<br>

## Setup Meteor Demodulator Plugin<br>

Meteor Demodulator plugin sends received data in real time to Lrpt-Decoder via TCP Local Host connection (127.0.0.1) and/or can record and write a raw file called S-file.<br>

Auto searchcarrier inside the Meteor Demodulator Plugin tunes to currently in use frequency.<br>
Meteor streams and lock on the signal if its strong enough.</p>
<p> When Sat Tracking is checked it uses Doppler correction for a faster signal lock.</p>

<img src="img/OQPSK.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="556"><br>

Note Tracking info will only displayed when the Satellite is active!</p>
<p>Config button is used to change the default PLL Bandwidth Value and a save path for writing the S-file.</p>
<img src="img/oqpsk.png" alt="" width="237" height="317"><br>

People who are not using DDE-Tracking Client, and running the Meteor Demodulator Plugin manual <b>Meteor M-N2-3 is using OQPSK Modulation</b>, make sure to select it!<br>

How Meteor Demodulator plugin works:<br>

If Satellite elevation &gt; 0 (AOS) trigger the start of applications needed for the receiving session:<br>
Meteor Demodulator first synchronizes with the signal in frequency configuration of the modulation speed and modulation type (satellite name).<br>
Automatic speed detection determines the symbolic flow rate.<br>

There is no need to change the decoder settings when changing 72K / 80K and M2 / M2-3 <br>
LRPT-Decoder will receive signal information from the Meteor Demodulator plugin.<br>

Only after synchronization in frequency and symbol rate Meteor Demodulator plugin begin to transmit data to the decoder.<br>
In the first block of data, the settings go to the decoder (automatically determined or set).<br>

<img src="img/small.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="362"><br>
The decoder, until it receives data keeps the decoder window minimized.<br>

After receiving the first data block, the decoder is initialized and begins to work building up an image line by line.<br>
Without capturing the signal by Meteor Demodulator (after all, reception goes through the demodulator), the window will not close.<br>

If Meteors pass is over (LOS) Plugin will be inactive and LrptDecoder also quits saving received images.<br>

Since Meteor Demodulator V2.3 a new scheduler command "M2_decoder_init_Line &lt;&gt;" has been added to the plugin.<br>

Using it, you can transfer any commands that are in the M2_LRPT_Decoder.ini file of the LRPT-Decoder.<br>

 <b>Example scheduler options:</b><br>

M2_decoder_init_Line &lt;rgb=123.jpg&gt; or (rgb=125,444,555 depending which mode Meteor is using), overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>
M2_decoder_init_Line&lt;path=C:\Meteor\ImagesM2&gt; - Path to save images for M-N2 or M-N2-2, overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>

M2_decoder_init_Line&lt;RoughStartTimeUTC=now&gt; - Using RoughStartTimeUTC = Now from the plugin, then Time will be initialized automatically at the moment of receipt of the first data, overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>
M2_decoder_init_Line&lt;TleFileName=C:\Meteor\LRPT_Decoder\M2-2.txt&gt; - Path Meteor TLE File for Georef, overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>

Make sure to enter these commands before the demodulator and decoder start entries.<br>
QPSK_demodulator_Start<br>
start_program_Path - Path&nbsp; to LRPT-Decoder<br>

<b>In order for the decoder to work with Meteor Demodulator, the ini-file mode and sat entries must be assigned to auto!</b><br>

Inside M2_LRPT_Decoder.ini change:<br>

mode=auto<br>
sat=auto<br>

There is no need to change the decoder settings when changing 72K / 80K and M2 / M2.2.<br>

LRPT-Decoder will receive signal information from the Meteor Demodulator plugin automatic detection mode of symbol speed.<br>
And the type of modulation is determined by the choice of satellite M2 / M22.<br>

In this mode, you can generally remove the term PSK_set_SymbolRate &lt;&gt; from the scheduler or set PSK_set_SymbolRate &lt;Auto&gt;.<br>
Changes practically do not affect the reception quality.<br>

It is enough to change the speed in the scheduler.<br>

M2 LRPT-Decoder compatible with these functions is above Version 50.<br>

## Setup LRPT-Decoder for Meteor</h2>

The idea is to run 1 LRPT-Decoder for multiple Meteor satellite's and this should reduce the number of settings that must be done when Meteor changes operating modes.<br>

This allows to modify the settings when changing the reception conditions only in the scheduler from DDE Tracking Client,<br>
and not in the entire chain of programs for processing the signal from the satellite.<br>

<b>DDE-Tracker client scheduler setup for Meteor M-N2-3:</b><br>

<img src="img/M-N2.2_cfg.png" alt="" width="722" height="368"><br>

The<b> difference between Meteor M-N2 and N2-2/2-3 is QPSK Modulation</b> &lt;- OQPSK_demodulator_Start mode must be selected for M-N2-3!<br>

<b>If you want to use georeference for mapping boundaries or test ect, include:</b><br>
M2_decoder_init_Line&lt;RoughStartTimeUTC=now&gt; - Using RoughStartTimeUTC = Now from the plugin, then Time will be initialized automatically at the moment of receipt of the first data, overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>
M2_decoder_init_Line&lt;TleFileName=C:\Meteor\LRPT_Decoder\M2-2.txt&gt; - Path Meteor TLE File for Georef, overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>

M2_decoder_init_Line &lt;rgb=123.jpg&gt; or (rgb=125,444,555 depending which mode Meteor is using), overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>

<b>If you do not want all received images into 1 folder:</b><br>
M2_decoder_init_Line&lt;path=C:\Meteor\ImagesM22&gt; - Path to save images for M-N2-2, overrides path in decoder ini file.<br>

OQPSK_demodulator_Start - QPSK Plugin is triggered to start from DDE Tracking Client by this command only for M-N2-2.<br>
send_tracking_frequency_On - Starting Doppler frequency correction for Meteor Demodulator Plugin carrier if the Satellite is active (If this is unwanted remove the command).<br>

start_program_Path - Path&nbsp; to LRPT-Decoder for startup run.bat (do not use a path with spaces example program files!).<br>
The batch file run.bat point's to LRPTDecoder.exe and already included in the LRPT-decoder folder/archive, just enter its path &lt;your path\run.bat&gt; to the scheduler.<br>

<b>Batch file contents:</b><br>

## Other Tools<br>

Image editing:<br>

There are 2 excellent programs to edit Meteor's saved images, SmoothMeteor from Les Hamilton and LRPT Image Processor from David Taylor both are freeware.<br>
They have option to rectify the image so the 'Fish-eye' effect is gone, Create False colors on RGB125 images, Flip Infrared Nighttime images and convert them with a negative effect so they look like NOAA IR Images.<br>
And many other options.<br>

Some extra explanation about Meteor images:<br>

When you save a Meteor image as an RGB125 BMP image, the image actually contains all the information for the three separate channels.<br>
If you wish to store your Meteor images for the future, this is the best way.<br>

The new version of SmoothMeteor recognizes the 125.BMP part of the filename, and opens up the Palette menu.<br>

Here you find options to add palettes to the images.<br>

But you can also combine the channels in different ways: the RGB122 that is often used in LRPTofflineDecoder, but also the RGB125 (using the inverted channel 5), which is the same as the common colour composites made from NOAA HRPT channels 1+2+4.<br>

There are also options to save each of the individual grey scale channels.<br>

Meteor M-N2-2 Telemetry Unpacker:<br>

Only for Meteor M-N2-2 not working exactly on M-N2-3!<br>
N-2-2 has a new different way of processing Telemetry on PID70 e.g. info from Glonass and its position.<br>

Program for unpacking telemetry from APID70 for testing.<br>

Set APID70=yes in M2_LRPT_Decoder.ini [OUT] section.<br>

It starts like this:<br>

M22TelemetryUnpaker.exe 2019_07_29_LRPT_14-39-35.s.70<br>
for unpacking 2019_07_29_LRPT_14-39-35.s.70,<br>
will be formed 2019_07_29_LRPT_14-39-35.s.70.csv<br>

Added to the telemetry unpacker information of TLE and the calculation of coefficients, polynomials of the fourth degree representing the roll, pitch and yaw of Meteor M-N2-2.<br>
TLE can be used in Orbitron and for geo-referencing processing.<br>
Roll, pitch, yaw can improve snapping to absolute accuracy!<br>
